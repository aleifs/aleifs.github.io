I am a PhD candidate in economics at [SÃ£o Paulo School of Economics](https://economics-sp.fgv.br/) and a researcher at [FGV EESP CLEAR](https://fgvclear.org/en/). I hold a MSc in economics and a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [Federal University of Bahia](https://www.ufba.br/). I am interested in applied microeconomics and macro development, specially topics related to labor economics and education. My research focuses on the effects of affirmative action in higher education and the effects of child labor on educational attainment and talent allocation.
